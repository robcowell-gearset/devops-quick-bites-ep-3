Included in this repository is an example Salesforce project, in SFDX format for Visual Studio Code, to accompany Episode 3 of DevOps Quick Bites.

It includes a custom object, an Apex class, a Lightning Web Component and a Flow - and more importantly, TESTS for those items.

This is shared purely for illustration and education, I'm unlikely to take pull requests for this repository.
